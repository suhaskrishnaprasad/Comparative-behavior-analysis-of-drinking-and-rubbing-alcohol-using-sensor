By implementing this system, I aim to create a mechanism to prevent drunk driving. It combines the alcohol 
detection capability of the MQ3 sensor and the push button to ensure that only sober drivers can start the 
vehicle's engine. The buzzing sound from the buzzer serves as a clear warning, while the prevention of 
ignition activation provides an additional layer of safety. It strives to significantly reduce the number of 
alcohol-related accidents and protect both the intoxicated drivers and other road users from the potentially 
devastating consequences of driving under the influence. In summary, when the driver is drunk and the MQ3 
sensor detects alcohol, the buzzer alerts the driver, and attempting to start the ignition will be unsuccessful. 
However, if the driver is sober, the buzzer remains silent, and they can successfully start the ignition to 
operate the vehicle safely.
